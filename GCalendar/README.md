## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).

Code is a simple calendar and just needs to be run on VS code. Use the previous and next buttons to cycle through months. As you pass into a new year, the UI should update to show current year.

Json settings and launch files are needed to run, with jar libraries for javaFX from javasdk. Add vmArgs for module paths with javafx.graphics and so on.
